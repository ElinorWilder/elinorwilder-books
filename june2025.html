      <h1>June 2025 – I Saw a Dove’s First Flight</h1>

      <p>Hi, and welcome.</p>
      <p>I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits.</p>

      <p>This month, I'm deep in the world of Reed and Annelie. I'm exploring what it takes for two introverted, intelligent, private people who haven't found their place in this world to open up to each other when they really don't know each other well yet.</p>

      <h2>Updates from the Cabin</h2>
<p>Recently I witnessed the first flight of a baby mourning dove whose nest sits right next to my kitchen window. I've been watching the parents build their home, then the hatchling grow. When that little one finally took flight, the parent did this celebration dance that felt like pure joy.</p>

<p>I have tried to include the GIF below. Hope it works! Moments like these remind me why I write about finding home in unexpected places.</p>

      <h2>ARC Review Team</h2>
      <p>I'm building an early access review team for the Wilder series. <a href="https://indiesunlimited.com/2014/01/10/reviewing-101-part-1/" target="_blank">How do I write reviews?</a> Honest reviews help other readers find the stories. <a href="https://forms.gle/VLGWTTpKL44pS7wx6" target="_blank">[Join my ARC team]</a></p>
