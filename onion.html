She's a financial analyst from Wall Street. Brilliant, scattered, and burnt out—but not extinguished.
He's a former special operations soldier with alpha wolf in his blood—and a high-maintenance macaw. Exiled from his pack. Unable to bond.

Now they live on the same remote mountain—one drawn by desperation, the other by instinct.
She doesn't expect a neighbor. He doesn't expect a bond.

But when she shows up on his door with a basket of onions, a luminous smile, and a rambling theory about the five essential foods everyone needs daily, her whirlwind presence, unexpected courage and deep kindness begin to unravel both the man and the wolf.

When she encounters a mysterious wolf in the wilderness, she must face the truth—the pull she feels is more than her imagination.
And the man across the meadow is not what he seems.
