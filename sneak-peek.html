<h3>&ldquo;Headless Romeo&rdquo;</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I leaned against the doorframe, watching her work. She ignored me as usual. And I decided to strike up a conversation nevertheless. Like usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re a cardiac surgeon, you must work with all sorts of animals. What&rsquo;s your favorite animal? Spirit animal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t look up from whatever she was doing. After a beat, she replied, &ldquo;Black widow spider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A spider?&rdquo; I straightened, my interest piqued. &ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve thought it would be a bigger animal. Why a spider?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the female bites off the male&rsquo;s head after mating.&rdquo;</p>

<p> My brain stalled for a moment, trying to process that. Then the laughter hit me, deep and rolling from my chest. I couldn&rsquo;t stop it. Of course she would choose that. What did that make me? The headless Romeo?</p>

<p>I dipped my head and mock-saluted her. I thought I lost this round, but there, as I stood laughing, spreading across her cheeks was a streak of faint pink.</p>

<p><em>Jesus.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never seen her blush before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a good one. You have a hidden sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time she looked up, met my gaze. Dark eyes flashed with her typical intensity. &ldquo;You would be the first one to say that, Major.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am honored, Doctor,&rdquo; I grinned. &ldquo;I hope to be the first of many things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked away immediately but that pink on her cheeks deepened, spreading like watercolor across paper. Inside my mind, my wolf danced around shamelessly. The fools that we were. Headless Romeo, indeed.</p>
