  <p>Crouching down, I pulled open the top drawer under the kitchen countertop in Emma&rsquo;s tiny kitchen. Scout immediately shoved his entire head in there, making me chuckle in exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud, there&rsquo;s creamer and coffee pods, not bones.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t care. I left him to root around while I opened another one. Hazelnut creamer again. Damn. With a sinking heart, I opened the last one. It was full of the same.</p>
<p>I blew a breath to calm myself down. It wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. Even though I hated the stuff, I could tolerate it for one morning. I was a big boy, a fucking alpha. Grumbling under my breath, I started the coffee maker and waited for the cabin to fill with that cloying smell. The memory came back from our student days as if it was only yesterday.</p>
<p>Clearly, I needed to go shopping. Preferably this very afternoon. Better to check if Emma had anything suitable for cooking, or were it all her granola-cardboard-bars boxes? Scout diligently followed me around as I explored, opening and inspecting every nook and cranny of the kitchen, that was basically just a wall with cabinets and a cooktop range with a single burner. I loved the minimalist setup. I did. Just the hazelnut creamer was about to get on my nerves.</p>
<p>Why was I surprised though? Emma had always loved that shit. It was that thought that made me realize the coffee had finished brewing and yet I was fine. How had I forgotten that I could no longer smell her annoying flavor? And why was I not happy about it? I didn&rsquo;t have to be annoyed anymore. But the pain that hit me was a shock. I could no longer smell it. My brain was replaying a memory that felt like I could only see in black and white. The color version was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Connor?&rdquo; Emma&rsquo;s sleepy voice snapped me back to the present.</p>
