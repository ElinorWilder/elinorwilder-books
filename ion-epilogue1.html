We decided to grab lunch—Connor and Scout were both starving by the time we were back on the road. There was a small diner right next to the clinic, so we decided to stop there. I went to the restroom because I suddenly found myself caring about my appearance, spending an unusual ten minutes washing my face, brushing my teeth, and trying to tame my hair.
Stepping out of the restroom, I caught sight of Connor at our booth. He’d taken off his jacket, and the black T-shirt revealed the veins running along his bare forearms. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he spoke to the waitress.
“One burger with no sauce—”
“No sauce at all?” the waitress interrupted, pen hovering over her notepad. “Not even ketchup?”
“No sauce. And no mayo either.”
“Okay…”
“No cheese. Please make sure that the lettuce is crisp and must be iceberg—”
“Iceberg specifically?”
“Yes, and not wilted. On the side. The tomato has to be thick cut, also on the side.”
She was blinking at him now. “And the fries?”
“No salt.”
Those impossibly blue eyes looked up at her. “Do you have cherry-flavored slushies?”
When she nodded, he continued, “Light on the ice, please. And for the dog, three hamburger patties with no buns.”
Listening to him rattle off every single detail of my food sensitivities—the exact same ones I’d had in college—made my chest tight with emotion. After all these years, he still remembered. He knew I hadn’t changed, wouldn’t change, that these weren’t quirks I’d grow out of, but simply who I was.
After the waitress walked away shaking her head, Connor’s gaze found mine across the diner. My heart skipped.
Scout bounded over just then, so I gave him some good scritches. Connor stood up to help me slide into the booth, helping me with my ankle boot, but instead of sitting across from each other, once I was seated in the booth, Connor chose to sit right next to me. Scout slid under the table and flopped down across both our feet. The waitress returned moments later with a bowl of water, setting it down next to Scout.
Connor settled his arm along the back of the booth, immediately enveloping me in his warmth. The way his broad frame curved around the space created this intimate little cocoon, just for me. The tip of his finger was barely touching my collarbone, and my entire consciousness seemed to zero in on that single point of contact, that whisper-light brush of his fingertip.
I turned my head to look up at him and couldn’t stop my eyes from roaming all over his face. He was chewing gum and that simple act made the sharp edges of his jaw stand out. He stared back, and neither of us said anything. My heart rate started climbing as moments passed, and the air between us felt charged. The urge to kiss him overtook every other thought process.
I was glad I had brushed my teeth because my breath was minty fresh. I leaned in and let my lips touch his, the light prickle of stubble on his jaw contrasting with the softness of his lips. Tentatively, I licked his lips and was delighted when he tasted like cherry.
I pulled away slightly. “You smell of cherry. Is that the gum?”
His lips curved in that smile that had always scrambled my thoughts. Happily, I went back to sucking on his lower lip, pulling it into my mouth and biting down slightly, giving him a taste of what he had done to me at the chopper. I could feel his whole body reacting to that. The hand that was on the booth curled around me until he was holding me against his broad chest while I explored his mouth to my heart’s content. Encouraged by his reaction, I traced the outline of his lips with the tip of my tongue and then the seam of his mouth. When I tried to push my tongue between his lips, he broke the kiss with a groan.
His chest rose and fell as he breathed heavily and turned his face away from me. “Emma, you’re killing me,” he said, his voice wrecked. “If you don’t stop, we’ll get charged with public indecency or something.” That last part he said as he turned to me with a corner of his lips raised in his trademark wry smile.
“Disorderly conduct, subsection 647(a) of the penal code.”
He blinked, then raised his eyebrows. “Why do you know that?”
I just grinned and shrugged.
The waitress appeared with a loaded tray, giving us both a knowing look. She set down our plates with practiced efficiency, and to her credit, didn’t look at me like I was a weirdo when I pulled my plate towards me. Crouching down to slide Scout’s three hamburger patties under the table, she gave him a pat and said, “There you go, big guy.”
For the next twenty minutes, both Connor and Scout became laser-focused on their food, with an intensity that bordered on feral. Neither paid me one ounce of attention as they demolished their meals. I picked at my perfectly ordered burger, watching with amusement as Connor inhaled his double cheeseburger like he hadn’t eaten in days—which, I realized, he probably hadn’t.
After Connor had nearly finished his burger, he glanced up and caught my amused expression. “What?” he asked.
I smiled. “The way you inhale your food.” He shrugged. “I can’t smell it, but I’m still hungry.”
He looked down at his empty plate, his jaw ticking.
My heart felt heavy. “I’m truly sorry about that, Connor. How can I help?”
His fingers drummed once against the table as he stared at his empty plate. “Actually, you already have. Knowing that you don’t think of me as defective… I’ve been trying to come to terms with this for the past decade, but I needed to see your reaction. Not just because you’re my goober girl, but because you’re Emma.”
I slowly moved my hand across the table toward his, which lay flat against the surface. My knuckles brushed against his fingers, a light touch. He looked down at our hands, side by side on the worn formica. His pinky shifted first, hooking around mine. Then his other fingers followed, sliding between mine until our hands were interlaced, his thumb settling over my knuckles.
“I can trust you to be honest, and you don’t realize how much that matters in a world where everybody says things just to please you or to be polite. Your unflinching honesty makes all the difference.”
He took a deep breath, staring off into the distance.
“When I told you about my loss of scent, you didn’t say something trite to me. You didn’t give me false reassurance, saying that I’m still the same Connor and that it doesn’t make a difference.”
I rubbed my thumb against his knuckles. “Because it does make a difference. Whether we want it or not. It has changed your entire world, and nobody else can understand that except you. You have every right to grieve. I understand why you felt defective.” I glanced toward the diner window.
“That word is very interesting. I thought of myself as defective too. I still do. The Latin is ‘defectus’ - from ‘de’ meaning away from, and ‘facere’ meaning to make or do. So literally, unmade or undone.” I met his eyes. “So technically speaking, it is correct. You do not have the sense of smell. I do not have social skills. We both lack something, and in the face of it, that is all there is to it. However, when we use ‘defective,’ it is more than that. We falsely correlate the lack of certain skills to lack of worth, lack of value. And that cuts so deep when we think of ourselves as defective, because we extrapolate that just because we lack some skills, we also lack value - that we are somehow lesser as human beings. And that’s a fallacy.”
Connor’s expression grew tender, gratitude shining in his eyes. He lifted our joined hands and pressed his forehead to our hands. He just sat there with his eyes closed. I watched him.
Scout clambered out from under the table and shoved his face into Connor’s chest. That dog had such a keen read on Connor.
When Connor opened his eyes, he was smiling. “You always make sense of things. I love your brain, Emma.”
He kissed our joined hands and turned to Scout. “Thanks, bud. Ready to get out of here?”
Scout gave an enthusiastic bark. “Let’s go.”
After Connor paid the bill, he helped me slide out of the booth, his hands steady on my arms as I maneuvered with the ankle boot. We climbed back into his truck, Scout settling next to me like the world’s best fuzzy, thermal blanket. Connor started the engine and glanced over at me.
“Which way to your cabin?”
“Take Highway 33 north for about twenty miles, then turn right on Forest Service Road 47. It’s a dirt road that winds up the hill for another ten miles or so. My driveway is the only one at the very top—you can’t miss it.”
The drive took us through dense pine forests and rolling terrain that gradually became more remote. As I slurped on my slushie, I watched the landscape shift from occasional houses to nothing but wilderness. The road narrowed as we climbed higher, dust kicking up behind us on the unpaved Forest Service road.
“There,” I said, pointing to a barely visible break in the trees. “That’s my driveway.”
The gravel drive curved upward for another quarter mile before opening into a small clearing. Looking at it now, I saw how overgrown everything had become. Branches had crept closer to the walls, and moss was starting to claim the lower logs. The cabin looked smaller than I remembered, almost swallowed by the wilderness that had reclaimed parts of the clearing.
“I apologize. I have not been here in approximately three years, so it appears somewhat—”
“Emma, this place looks incredible,” Connor interrupted, genuine awe in his voice.
I perked up immediately, feeling a flutter of excitement. “Do you truly find it appealing?”
“Are you kidding? This is amazing.” He came around to open my door, helping me step down carefully with my ankle boot. After grabbing our backpacks from the truck bed and hoisting them onto his shoulders, we made our way toward the cabin.
The wooden ramp curved up along the side of the structure, leading to the elevated entrance. “This is a beautiful design,” Connor commented as we climbed. “Building it into the slope like this—brilliant.”
At the top of the ramp, the small deck wrapped around the massive pine tree that I had refused to cut down during construction. Instead, I had designed a circular opening in the deck to allow the trunk to grow through it. Connor ran his hand along the bark with appreciation. “You built around the tree?”
“I could not bring myself to remove it. It seemed more logical to incorporate it into the design.”
Inside, my single room opened up before us, dominated by the huge sectional couch I had positioned to face my wall of windows that looked out into the forest. The ceiling soared up to the small loft where my bed was tucked under the peaked roof. I had chosen not to install curtains or blinds—just glass and wilderness as far as you could see.
Connor set down our bags and turned slowly, taking it all in. “It’s efficient and minimalistic. This is incredible, Emma.”
He moved to the kitchen area and filled a bowl with water for Scout, setting it down near the couch. Connor’s eyes caught on the ladder, and a smile tugged at his lips. “Is this inspired by your favorite scene from Beauty and the Beast?”
I felt my face light up with excitement. “You remember that! Yes, exactly like when Belle is on the ladder in the library. I have always wanted one of those.”
“Of course I remember. You made me watch that scene about fifty times,” he said with fond amusement, running his hand along the ladder’s rail.
“The couch converts to a bed as well,” I added, realizing I would not be able to climb to the loft with my ankle boot. “Which is fortunate given my current mobility limitations.”
Connor immediately unfolded the couch to turn into a bed and went up to my loft-bedroom to bring down pillows and blankets. Meanwhile, Scout began inspecting the space, nose to the ground, tracing the room’s entire perimeter. He sniffed along the baseboards, investigated my couch thoroughly, and finally settled himself in the cozy space beneath the moveable library ladder that led up to the loft.
Leaving them to their tasks, I made my way to the giant picture window, careful with my ankle boot. While Connor was busy fluffing the pillows on the couch to make a pillow nest, I let my eyes take in the peaceful, lush surroundings of my cabin. “There is a small brook that runs just beyond those trees,” I said, pointing toward the forest. “In winter, when everything is covered in snow, the entire landscape transforms. It’s like stepping into a different dimension, as if into a pocket universe—”
Connor’s arms slipped around my waist from behind, and I felt his face nestle into the crook of my neck. My words died completely as his warm breath touched my skin.
“Emma,” he murmured against my throat, and I could feel the vibration of his voice run through my entire body.
My hands came up to cover his forearms where they crossed my waist, and I leaned back into his solid warmth. Through the windows, the vista stretched endlessly before us, but all I could focus on was the way his lips brushed just below my ear.
I was about to twist in his arms to kiss him when his right hand began sliding up—first over my stomach, then my diaphragm, until he reached the underside of my breast. I forgot what I was going to do. His finger traced the curve, and I melted like putty in his hand. His thumb covered my nipple through my skintight thermal top, brushing the pad back and forth across the peak in slow, deliberate strokes. When he had changed me into the thermals in the cave, he had removed my wet bra. I trembled. My head fell back on his shoulder and my eyes closed of their own volition. My body pulsed with sensitivity, only fabric standing between his fingers and my bare skin. He moved his hand to my other breast, and I moaned as his thumb gently flicked the hardened tip.
“Emma,” he whispered hoarsely, trailing his mouth along the column of my neck, down to my collarbone.
When his whole hand shifted, cupping my breast in his palm, I was sure I ascended directly to heaven. I had never been touched by anyone, never been with any man. Even though I had researched how all of this worked, I was completely unprepared for the intensity of my body’s reaction. I felt myself throbbing between my legs, my heart beating just as wildly, and all I could manage to do was moan helplessly. Soft gasps and moans escaped me as he continued to circle my nipple and leave a trail of wet kisses on my skin.
I couldn’t take it anymore. In desperation, I grabbed his other hand from my stomach and pushed it down between my legs. The ragged groan from him had me moaning in response.
“You’re so wet.”
“Please,” I begged.
He picked me up in a swift motion and carried me to the couch-bed, laying me down carefully. I finally got a good look at him, and oh my lord. Connor had always been strikingly handsome, but in this mood, he was absolutely devastating. His eyes were hooded, skin flushed, and hair mussed up as he stood looking down at me with his erection tenting the front of his jeans. I wanted to touch it with my hand but I couldn’t due to my damn ankle so I raised my good leg and placed my bare foot right there and rubbed gently.
“Stop,” he gasped. “I won’t…” His hips jerked forward into my feet even as he said it, his body craving the friction. He grasped my foot with both hands, eyes closed tight, and groaned. “Emma, I won’t last.”
“Oh! How come? Don’t you need to…umm…go on and on?”
He opened his eyes and gave me a very confused and turned-on smile. “What?”
“In the books I read—”
“Books?”
“For research obviously. Well, the hero has to stroke, pump, twist and do this and that, they even say piston which makes me think of combustion engine to be honest—”
He bent down over me, placing his hand on my mouth before I could finish, and then he was laughing into my neck, his whole body shaking in quiet laughter.
“What?” I grinned.
“I…” he raised his head and with tears of laughter in his pretty eyes, he shook his head once before continuing. “Maybe when we are old and I am all dried up, it will take all that gymnastics, but for a guy, as inexperienced as me, who has been…well, I’ve waited a long time, love. I can’t control myself.”
I blinked. That sounded so romantic. Why did it sound so beautiful? Oh! But… “Wait a minute! Inexperienced?”
He rested himself on his elbows and stared down at me. “What are you thinking?”
“I mean…you’re so handsome and of course, there would be so many…” I trailed off when he raised an eyebrow in a dire warning.
“So, have you never…?”
“No..”
I was in shock. Had he truly been single? All this time? For me?
“You?” He asked.
I shook my head. “Obviously not.”
“You have no idea how gorgeous you are. Don’t look at me like that. I fell for you within the first month. With your brains and this body, fuck, Emma, you’re a walking wet dream.”
I stared in disbelief. What?! He looked back steadily and I couldn’t see an ounce of false assurance or pandering in his gaze. He had never lied to me, so why would he start now?
“I think this might be the best day of my life,” I said slowly, still in awe.
Suddenly, a big hairy body jumped on the couch-bed and the next moment, I was being licked all over my face. I squealed.
“Scout, buddy,” Connor chuckled. “She doesn’t want your slobber all over her.”
Scout gave a happy bark and then rolled over until he was stretched out next to me, his tummy exposed, tongue out, tail wagging.
Connor sat up and wiped my face with the edge of a sheet. “What do you want, sweetheart?”
“You in me.” I replied immediately. “But umm, how old is he?”
“Who? Scout?”
“Yes.”
“Nine. Why?”
“Okay, then, too young. Not in front of him.”
He barked a laugh and dipped his head, his ears turning a delicious red, before asking, “I’ll let him out but I don’t have condoms. Do you?”
“We don’t need them.”
“Do you still have the IUD?”
I nodded.
“Okay,” he slowly stood up and gestured to Scout. “C’,mon, bud, let’s go.”
“Wait!” I blurted out. “Come here. I want to take off your jeans.”
“Now?”
I nodded. He took a deep breath and slowly moved back onto the bed and positioned himself above me. I unzipped him carefully, my eyes glued to my hands, as I unwrapped him like a gift. He was the damn best gift I had gotten myself. I pulled down the jeans as far down as I could before it got stuck. The little spot of moisture on his underwear sent shivers through me.
“Okay, you get the rest and then, you can let him out.”
Connor didn’t say a word. He peeled off the jeans from his long, muscular legs and folded them neatly instead of throwing them haphazardly, as I would have. Then he turned his back to me and I squealed internally, watching his broad back and the way his butt moved as he walked out of the cabin. I was very proud of myself.
The sound of Scout’s nails clicking across the deck faded as Connor settled him outside. I could hear the murmur of Connor’s voice through the windows, then his footsteps returning. The door closed with a soft click, and suddenly the cabin felt much smaller, much more intimate.
“Emma, I think we need to take the boot off.”
“Oh, right. Okay. I had forgotten about my ankle. Power of adrenaline!” I grinned.
He bent down with one knee on the couch and carefully slid off the boot, watching my face for any reaction, but I felt nothing. The pain meds and my excitement were a potent combination. Once it was out, he set it down on the floor and turned back to me. “Going to take off your clothes.”
I nodded mutely. The sounds of our heavy breathing were the only thing that could be heard in the cabin for the next several moments, as he undressed me painstakingly slowly, his calloused hands setting my skin on fire wherever they touched. I rubbed myself, my fingers slick, and getting more wet by the second. Finally, he took off his underwear and set it atop his folded jeans.
“I want to look. Lie down for me.”
Connor ducked his head, his throat flushing pink before he climbed over the couch and lay back next to me, staring at the ceiling. I could see his breathing quicken, a vein throbbing in his throat. I propped myself on my elbow and took him in, fascinated by his erection. It curved to a side and there was a vein that ran along its length. The head was a pretty pink, with fluid leaking from the slit on top.
“Are you done?” he asked.
“Mmmm, not yet. It’s really…arresting.” I looked at his face, then back down. “I thought your face was my favorite thing to look at, but now…it’s close competition.”
Connor hid his face under his forearm, laughing.
“Oh, it jumped!”
Connor just lay there quietly dying. I touched wherever I could reach with one hand—the hard muscles of his shoulders, his flat abs—until my hand brushed against his penis and he jerked. “Emma,” he groaned.
“Okay, okay, I’m done. For now.”
He rose on all fours and lined himself up, our eyes locked. “Put your hand on mine.”
I did as told and together we slowly guided him inside me inch by inch. My heart was beating so loud that I could feel it shake my chest with every beat. He was waiting for me to move, both of us beyond words, but I needed a moment. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, stilled the hand that was touching myself, and centered myself. This moment had been carved through years of pain and longing, of loss and grief so deep it had cut through our souls, and I wanted to burn it into my memory forever.
When I opened my eyes, I had tears and for a moment he looked alarmed. But I gave him a watery smile. “I’m ready. Let’s remember this moment, okay? You’re my everything, my best friend, my guardian, my anchor in any storm. I am yours, in heart and mind, always was, and always will be. Make me yours in body too.”
He moved slowly, deliberately, like he was indeed memorizing the moment. His breath caught against my neck, and all he could manage was a whispered ‘Always yours’ before his composure shattered completely. His rhythm became uneven, desperate, and when he came with a broken sound, the intensity of it pulled me over the edge with him, my cry mixing with his.
Afterward, we lay tangled together on the couch bed, both of us breathing heavily. My cabin settled around us with small creaking sounds. Through the wall of windows, I watched the afternoon light paint the forest in patches of gold and shadow. Connor’s body was heavy, like a weighted blanket, making me feel grounded and so satiated that I didn’t want to move. Ever. I pressed my face into Connor’s chest and felt his breathing slow as sleep claimed him. He hadn’t slept in who knows how long. But Scout was still outside and I couldn’t move without hurting my ankle so I had to reluctantly disturb him.
“Hey,” I pressed a kiss to his jaw.
“Hmm,” his breath puffed against my ear. I loved his sleepy voice.
“Scout needs to come in, sorry.”
With a groan, he rolled over and managed to hoist himself up. I watched him, his glorious naked form, let Scout inside, then move around the cabin gathering supplies. He returned with a warm washcloth and cleaned me gently and thoroughly.
“I’m gonna pass out, sorry, I’m dead tired. We’ll talk later. Need anything?” He asked me with a soft smile.
“Nah. Just you.”
When he returned after disposing of the wet washcloth somewhere proper, he put my ankle boot back on, and then tucked us both under layers of soft sheets and blanket.
“Good?” he pressed a kiss on my cheek.
“Yes, you sleep now.”
Scout settled himself across both our legs. I felt his breathing slow as he fell asleep almost instantly. I lay awake listening to both of them snoring softly. For the first time in many years, I wasn’t alone in the wilderness.
I had never been a free ion but now I knew what I was bonded to. I had found my nucleus.
