<i>Where finding your true self changes everything</i>    

Novella: Not A Free Ion  
<i>STEM Meets Supernatural</i>  

She's a brilliant research biologist whose mind sees patterns in fire-adapted ecosystems. She has never fit anywhere after she lost her person but never stopped searching.
He's a federal K9 search-and-rescue specialist with alpha wolf in his blood and a German Shepherd K9 partner. Without a pack, without a permanent address, and without the most important shifter sense of scent.

She never stopped loving him. He never stopped wearing the soft jacket she loved.

When lightning strikes trigger deadly cave-ins in the Claw Ridge Mountains, he feels a pull he can't ignore. Following his instincts into unstable terrain, he discovers the trapped researcher is sheâ€”the woman he fell in love with 13 years ago.
Thrown into a world where hypothermia threatens her life and his broken senses might not be enough to save her, will they find their way back to each other before it's too late?      </p>
