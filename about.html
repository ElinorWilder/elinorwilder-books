   <p>
    Elinor Wilder lives on a quiet mountain where the trees are tall, the wind is sharp, and the sea is always somewhere far below.
</p>
<p>
    She writes heartfelt shifter romance with neurodivergent leads, tortured/wounded alphas, and character driven arcs.
</p>
<p>
    Her Claw Ridge Series follows wildland firefighter shifters in the Teton Mountains who find their mates among women who've never fit conventional molds – from Wall Street burnouts to autistic veterinarians.
</p>
<p>
    She focuses on authentic representation, sensory-rich storytelling, and bonds that form through emotional safety rather than instalust.
</p>
<p>
    In her books you will find found family, protector alphas, and love stories where being different becomes the reason you're chosen.
  <p>
    She shares her cabin with two cats and an abundance of wildlife that treat her property like their personal highway.
</p>
<p>
    When she's not writing heart-pounding wilderness romances with impossible rescues and competent heroes, she's probably outside, pretending she's not waiting for wolves.
