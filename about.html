    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Elinor Wilder lives on a quiet mountain where the trees are tall, the wind is sharp,<br>
      and the sea is always somewhere far below.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shares her cabin with four unruly dogs and one cat who does not believe he lives there—but you know how cats are.
    </p>
    <p>
      She collects feathers, bones, and bits of weathered wood, turning them into art no one ever sees.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she’s not writing emotionally intense wilderness romances, she’s probably outside, pretending<br>
      she’s not waiting for wolves.
