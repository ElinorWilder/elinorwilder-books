      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Elinor Wilder lives on a quiet mountain where the trees are tall, the wind is sharp,<br>
        and the sea is always somewhere far below.
      </p>
      <p>
        She shares her cabin with four unruly dogs and one cat who does not believe he lives there—but you know how cats are.
      </p>
      <p>
        She collects feathers, bones, and bits of weathered wood, turning them into art no one ever sees.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she’s not writing emotionally intense wilderness romances, she’s probably outside, pretending<br>
        she’s not waiting for wolves.
