  <p></p>
  <p>Crouching down, I pulled open the top drawer under the kitchen countertop in Emma&rsquo;s tiny kitchen. Scout immediately shoved his entire head in there, making me chuckle in exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud, there&rsquo;s creamer and coffee pods, not bones.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t care. I left him to root around while I opened another one. Hazelnut creamer again. Damn. With a sinking heart, I opened the last one. It was full of the same.</p>
<p>I blew a breath to calm myself down. It wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. Even though I hated the stuff, I could tolerate it for one morning. I was a big boy, a fucking alpha. Grumbling under my breath, I started the coffee maker and waited for the cabin to fill with that cloying smell. The memory came back from our student days as if it was only yesterday.</p>
<p>Clearly, I needed to go shopping. Preferably this very afternoon. Better to check if Emma had anything suitable for cooking, or were it all her granola-cardboard-bars boxes? Scout diligently followed me around as I explored, opening and inspecting every nook and cranny of the kitchen, that was basically just a wall with cabinets and a cooktop range with a single burner. I loved the minimalist setup. I did. Just the hazelnut creamer was about to get on my nerves.</p>
<p>Why was I surprised though? Emma had always loved that shit. It was that thought that made me realize the coffee had finished brewing and yet I was fine. How had I forgotten that I could no longer smell her annoying flavor? And why was I not happy about it? I didn&rsquo;t have to be annoyed anymore. But the pain that hit me was a shock. I could no longer smell it. My brain was replaying a memory that felt like I could only see in black and white. The color version was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Connor?&rdquo; Emma&rsquo;s sleepy voice snapped me back to the present.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, took a deep breath and turned around with a smile on my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, slept well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was wrapped inside at least three blankets with only her head poking out from her cocoon. Her hair was matted to one side of her head and drool had dried on her cheek. My throat closed with the love I felt for her. She was absolutely perfect. I wanted to see that face every morning for the rest of my life. I wanted to marry her. I jolted with that realization. What was I thinking? Emma had never been interested in marriage. She found the whole concept tedious. And why did we need it when we were bonded anyhow? But deep in my heart, a little voice insistently chimed that my wolf wanted her bonded in human terms too. She was ours. In every way possible. Claimed, wed, marked and declared forever.</p>
<p>Emma was watching me with wary eyes. Then her gaze swept across the floor where somehow Scout had managed to dump the pods and was now sniffing around for God knew what.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said in a small voice.</p>
<p>I frowned. &ldquo;For what? He made the mess, not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes tracked back through every open shelf in her kitchen and finally landed on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think&hellip;this was my escape cabin. There&rsquo;s only my items. You hate hazelnut creme. You must be disgruntled. Mad. If I knew one day you would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I raised a hand to stop her and took three strides to reach her. &ldquo;I am not mad, love. Why would I be mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at me with those huge eyes filled with raw honesty. &ldquo;Something is wrong. Don&rsquo;t lie to me, Connor. I know I am difficult. It&rsquo;s all fine when I am just someone to spend an afternoon with but living with me? I&rsquo;m not fun. I&rsquo;m annoying and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please. Stop.&rdquo; I said hoarsely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurting me.&rdquo; I leaned down over the bed and pulled her into my arms. She came easily. Feeling her body melt against mine eased some of my heartache. I held her tight trying to tell her through my body just how wrong she was and just how gone for her I was. But I knew this was hard for her. Just like I struggled with my demons, she struggled with hers too. A wet tongue swiped down both our faces making us jerk apart and then Emma was being licked to the moon by Scout. She started giggling at his over the top enthusiastic consoling. Watching them both, my heart felt lighter and my mind clearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emma, let&rsquo;s talk, sweetheart. We are both assuming things. A lot has happened in the last 24 hours. Can I bring you your coffee and we can talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She smiled sweetly from under Scout&rsquo;s paws. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I kissed her hair and murmured &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome&rdquo; before going to the kitchen and pouring her coffee in one of the mugs. I made another for myself seeing as it wasn&rsquo;t going to bother me after all.</p>
<p>After handing over the coffee to her I set mine down on the floor and moved toward the foot of the couch-futon. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your ankle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starting to hurt. I think I need another dose of painkiller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on. Let me get that from the bag from the clinic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I need to get up, wash my face&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just sit tight.&rdquo; I retrieved her backpack. She always kept a bag of wipes. I knew the exact pocket it would be in and I was proven right. She had her systems set and those never changed. It made me stupidly happy. After handing over the wipes, I brought her the prescription bottle and a glass of water, watching as she winced while I carefully removed the walking boot. Her ankle was still swollen but the bruising was already fading to yellow-green.</p>
<p>Nothing felt loose or unstable so I helped prop her leg on a pillow while she settled back against the couch cushions, coffee mug balanced in both hands. Scout was following me around with that look on his face that meant &ldquo;I-am-too-well-trained-to-ask-but-may-I-please-have-a-treat&rdquo;? I held his treat in one hand and waited. Scout sat down on his haunches, his whole body quivering with excitement. After two seconds, when I was satisfied, I let him have it. Immediately, he jumped on the couch and settled down next to Emma, chomping happily. He had really taken to her and that meant everything to me. I lowered myself next to Emma and arranged her body so she could lean fully against me. While I combed my fingers through her hair, she took a slow sip and moaned in appreciation, making my cock twitch in response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about we take turns again? Each asks one question? Makes it fair,&rdquo; she asked in all innocence. That was Emma&rsquo;s favorite word. Fair. Along with justice. I couldn&rsquo;t help leaning down and kissing her quickly. Her surprised face told me she had no idea what she did to me. &ldquo;You go first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We sat quietly for a moment, both holding our coffee while Scout flopped down between us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, how did you find me? How did you know I was down in that cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Damn, she went for the jugular straight away. I petted Scout with a hand as I gathered my thoughts. &ldquo;This will require some explanation. Promise me that you&rsquo;ll hear me out first before you make any decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves, that is, shifters like me, we have a few extra&hellip;perceptions if you will. We have enhanced senses like I was telling you yesterday. One of them is the ability to sense one&rsquo;s mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat up straight. &ldquo;Mate? Like animals have mates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, same. Except it&rsquo;s a more binding and permanent connection. We call it the mate bond. Once a wolf is bonded to his mate, he is no longer attracted to anyone else. He cherishes her, protects her, provides for her and she is the center of his universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up from my mug to find Emma staring at me, her eyes bright with a mix of emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re expected to attempt the mating bite around the time we come of age. And anywhere from sixteen to twenty-five is when we mate-bond and find out who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the she-wolf?&rdquo; Emma whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the wolf woman? What does she feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh. I frowned. &ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know. I never stopped to think about it. But growing up, I remember the feelings seemed mutual.&rdquo; I racked my memory for anything specific. &ldquo;There was this one time when Raylia, one of the women in my pack, challenged Morgan. That&rsquo;s my half brother. He is the Alpha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strongest wolf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually, yes. But in modern times, it could also mean the most strategic and politically astute.&rdquo; I shook my head as the memory came back stronger. &ldquo;She stood no chance against him. But her mate was sick and Morgan was playing some dirty game to evict them. She shifted and right there in front of everyone she was ready to take him. It was insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. I get her 100%.&rdquo; Emma murmured and went back to sipping her coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; I knew I was bonded to her but I had never in my wildest dreams thought she could also be bonded to me. She was human if nothing else.</p>
<p>Emma nodded but refused to meet my gaze. A beat of silence passed. My pulse spiked. I looked at Scout who was flopped on the couch between us, his eyes shifting between me and her. As if he understood everything perfectly. &ldquo;So&hellip;to answer your question&hellip;you know where this is going, right?&rdquo; Despite everything, I was still apprehensive about the reveal of a bond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are bonded.&rdquo; She said the three words, still avoiding my eyes. &ldquo;Please tell me we are.&rdquo; It was said like a prayer. More to herself than to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head snapped and she stared at me wide eyed. &ldquo;To?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Reed, one of the men who helped with your rescue and is the strongest shifter I&rsquo;ve heard or seen, you know, the pilot, Wade&rsquo;s brother&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he thinks you and I have some special kind of bond. One that doesn&rsquo;t require a mating bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting. So you found me through this connection feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma nodded and went back to staring into her mug. She looked pensive. I watched her closely. She wasn&rsquo;t freaking out or panicking or any of the reactions I had prepared for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say something, love. I&rsquo;m a bit lost here,&rdquo; I chuckled wryly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a life changing moment for a shifter to be bonded. I&hellip;If you don&rsquo;t&hellip;I just need to know how you feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent ten years thinking I was broken because I couldn&rsquo;t move on from you. But I was never actually free. I was already bonded to you. I just didn&rsquo;t understand what that meant.&rdquo; Her voice shook. &ldquo;And then yesterday when you were sleeping next to me in the cave, I was so, so sure that I had found my way back. I felt alive and giddy with joy. Being in your arms&hellip;I have no words, Connor. Everything just clicked for me. But then you&hellip;why did you leave me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tear slid down her cheek. &ldquo;Why did you not follow us to the hospital? When Wade told me that you were not coming, I was sure I had managed to repel you off. It was worse than when you left back in uni. This time it felt like something was getting torn from my very core. I didn&rsquo;t want to&hellip;&rdquo; she trailed off. Her lips trembled and her face crumpled as she started crying softly. &ldquo;Why&hellip;what did I do wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart splintered at the sight. &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; I took her coffee mug and dropped it on the floor before wrapping my arms around her. &ldquo;Nothing. You did nothing. I&rsquo;m an asshole&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put a finger over my lips and looked at me through wet lashes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. It hurts me too when you talk like that about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cleared my throat and blinked several times. &ldquo;You said&hellip; &lsquo;no wolf&rsquo;. When you were delirious. It sounded like you were rejecting my wolf. Rejecting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I remember that! That was just my brain going Swiss cheese. I couldn&rsquo;t control my thoughts. But I was panicking because I didn&rsquo;t want you to find out that I knew your truth like that. I wanted to explain properly that I had found out and that your secret was safe with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh. Damn. I buried my face in her hair. &ldquo;Emma, I&rsquo;ve this stupid tendency to read rejection into the stupidest thing. I learned about it during therapy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma tightened her arms around me and clung to me. Scout shifted on his legs and scooted right between us turning it into a group hug. After several moments, she murmured, &ldquo;we are both very stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at her tone. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now you&rsquo;re mine. My stupid. If you leave again, I will kill you.&rdquo; I could hear the happiness in her voice. It matched what was inside my heart. I grinned into her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will revive you and kiss you and kidnap you.&rdquo; Emma was picking up steam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnap me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. I have the power of she-wolf bond now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My shoulders shook with silent laughter. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Scout and I will take you to a&hellip;mmm&hellip;cave. A better cave. Not with a vertical drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lifted my head up. I had to see her expression. She was beaming. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I replied with a serious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cave will be comfy. And then&hellip;I will marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart stopped and my whole body tensed up. Was I dreaming?</p>
<p>She peered at my face. &ldquo;Connor? You okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. This way you can&rsquo;t escape again. Legally you will be mine. And biologically, too. Hmm, I just need something to tie you physically to me as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My brain broke. This woman! Was she real? She was impossible. And mine.</p>
<p>I descended on her mouth with a sudden hunger that lit up my entire body. Emma squealed and protested something about not having brushed yet. I was having none of it. I had waited so long for this moment. I was going to show her just how physically tied she was to me.</p>
