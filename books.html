Series: Wildbond Books
<i>Where finding your true self changes everything</i>    

Book One: The Onion Came First
<i>A Neurodivergent Shifter Romance</i>
      
She's a brilliant financial analyst from Wall Street, whose mind works in beautiful, chaotic patterns. 
Burnt out from trying to fit somewhere. Exhausted but not extinguished.

He's a former special operations soldier with alpha wolf in his blood and a high-maintenance macaw. 
Exiled from his pack. Unable to bond.

Now they live on the same remote mountain, one drawn by inheritance, the other by instinct.

She doesn't expect a neighbor. He doesn't expect a bond.

But when she shows up at his door with a basket of onions, a luminous smile, and a rambling theory about the five essential foods everyone needs daily, her whirlwind presence and unexpected kindness begin to unravel both the man and the wolf.

Thrown into a world where the pull she feels might not be her imagination and the man across the meadow might not be what he seems, she must find the truth before it's too late.
