      <h1>Want Early Access to More Claw Ridge Stories?</h1>
   <p>
    If Connor and Emma's second chance touched your heart, you're exactly the kind of reader I'm looking for.
</p>
<p>
    I'm building my advance review team for the upcoming <strong>Claw Ridge Wildland Shifter Firefighters Series.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What you get:</strong><br>
    • Free advance copies 2-4 weeks before release<br>
    • The chance to help shape the series through your feedback and preferences
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What I'm looking for:</strong><br>
    • Readers who appreciate emotional depth in shifter romance<br>
    • People who love neurodivergent heroines and healing-focused stories<br>
    • Those who enjoy authentic characters over perfect ones
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time commitment:</strong> 2-3 weeks to read and leave an honest review on Amazon and Goodreads. If a book isn't for you, no worries—you don't have to leave a review. I would appreciate if you can just email me your thoughts instead of leaving a public review.
