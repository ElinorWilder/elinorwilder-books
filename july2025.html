      <h1>July 2025 â€“ largest tree on earthðŸŒ²</h1>

<p>I hope July has been bringing you warm summer evenings in your corner of the world.</p>

<p>I just got back from California's high desert country, where I stood beneath the largest tree on earth! There's something humbling about being in the presence of something that ancient and enduring â€” the General Sherman Tree is as tall as a 25-story building with a base so wide you could park six school buses end to end across it.</p>

<p>It is estimated to be between 2,300 and 2,700 years old, meaning it was already ancient when the Roman Empire fell! It put everything in perspective as I finished my novella as a debut author. The anticipation is both thrilling and nerve-wracking as I prepare to share Connor and Emma's story with my ARC team ðŸ˜¶.</p>

          <p><strong>Stay wild,<br>Elinor</strong></p>
